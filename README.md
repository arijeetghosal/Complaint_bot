THIS PROJECT IS DONE BY ARIJEET GHOSAL

This is the chatbot that I created for the complaint Bot. The Bot’s front end is designed in Streamlit and the back end is in Python. 

The work of the Complaint bot is fetching the deal's details from Pipedrive and then using the OpenAI API we can generate a report for further investigation. This project helps automate the manual work of looking at every activity inside a deal and fetching the right information based on all the activities. We also have a dialogue box to specify the activity that we particularly need.

The front end looks like this where we can enter the deal id and the subject of the complaint.


When we filled the right information it asks us to download the report in txt file and then it fetches all the details from pipedrive and displays.

This is the message that we can download in the txt file.
